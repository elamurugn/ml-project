    <h2>About the Tree Oxygen Recovery Project</h2>

    <p>
      The <strong>Tree Oxygen Recovery System</strong> is an intelligent, community-focused initiative designed to assist in rejuvenating the planet's oxygen balance. It is a modern digital platform that empowers users to take meaningful action in combating environmental degradation through informed tree planting.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our platform uses user-provided environmental inputs such as:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Soil Type</strong> – Determines which trees can thrive in the user’s specific region.</li>
        <li><strong>Sunlight Availability</strong> – Helps assess tree growth potential based on light exposure.</li>
        <li><strong>Water Level</strong> – Important for identifying water-dependent species.</li>
        <li><strong>Temperature</strong> – Filters trees suitable for the local climate.</li>
        <li><strong>Space Available</strong> – Ensures accurate tree density and oxygen output prediction.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      With this data, the system intelligently recommends high-oxygen-yielding tree species best suited for the conditions provided. It also provides an approximate timeline for how long it might take to restore the oxygen levels in the specified region, offering an effective guide for ecological restoration planning.
    </p>

    <p>
      This innovative tool is ideal for use by individuals aiming to green their backyards, community groups organizing afforestation drives, schools and colleges integrating environmental learning, and environmental NGOs. The system is simple and requires no complex sensors, devices, or technical setups — just knowledge and the will to act.
